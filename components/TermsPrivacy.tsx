Alternatively, a change may only be permissible subject to payment of an additional fee or charge.

Be aware that typically airlines will take between 60-90 days to process a refund. Please note that if we are entitled to a service fee for placing a booking, we will remain entitled to this fee if you cancel the booking or the Supplier fails to provide you with the Product for any reason (other than our default), including in an event of Force Majeure.

                    You will be required to pay a deposit (or deposits) when booking. The deposit amount varies depending on the Product booked and lead time to travel. In some instances, full payment is required at the time of booking and your consultant will advise the deposit amount at the time of booking. All deposits are non-refundable for changes of mind or cancellations by you (subject to your rights under the Australian Consumer Law). Where a deposit has been collected, final payment is required no later than six weeks prior to departure. Failure to make payment by the due date may result in your booking being cancelled and deposits forfeited.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    Payments made by direct deposit may take up to three business days to process. If you are paying by this method, you will need to make the payment at least three business days prior to the actual due date. You must notify you Consultant of your payment once it has been made.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    Payments made by personal cheque (excluding bank cheques) require five business days to process. If you are paying by this method, you will need to make the payment at least three business days prior to the actual due date. You agree not to stop payment of the cheque even when you cancel a booking. You agree that we may apply the proceeds of the cheque to satisfy any liability you have to us or to a Supplier, including any liability in respect of cancellation fees, before refunding the balance to you.

As a general rule, your travel documents will be available for collection two weeks prior to departure, however this will depend on your individual arrangements. Please contact your consultant to confirm when your travel documents are ready for collection.

                  We act as an agent for and sell various travel related products as an agent on behalf of numerous transport, accommodation and other service providers, such as airlines, coach, rail and cruise line operators, as well as travel wholesalers ("Suppliers"). We may receive fees, commissions, gifts or financial incentives from Suppliers in respect of Products we advise you of or arrange on your behalf. Any brochures provided by us to you are supplied by Suppliers, or are prepared by us based on content supplied by Suppliers, and we accept no liability for errors in that material. Your oral or written instructions to us are authority for us to make travel bookings on your behalf and to arrange relevant contracts between you and the applicable Supplier. Notwithstanding this authority, we are not your agent and do not have any fiduciary duty to you. We exercise care in the selection of reputable Suppliers, but we are not ourselves a provider of travel services and have no control over, or liability for, the Products provided by the Suppliers, who are third parties. All bookings are made on your behalf subject to the terms and conditions, including conditions of carriage and limitations of liability, imposed by the Supplier. We recommend that you read them before finalising the transaction and we can provide you with copies of the relevant terms and conditions on request. Your legal rights and remedies in connection with the provision of Products are against the Supplier and, except to the extent a problem is directly and primarily caused by fault on our part, are not against us. Specifically, if for any reason (excluding fault on our part) any Supplier is unable to provide the Product for which you have contracted either at all, or to the requisite standard, your remedies are against that Supplier and not against us.

Under circumstances where our liability cannot be excluded and where liability may be lawfully limited, such liability is limited to the remedies required of us under applicable law (including the Australian Consumer Law). In particular, we disclaim any liability for any consequential loss, including loss of enjoyment or amenity. This liability clause is subject to your rights under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms and conditions is intended to limit any rights you may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). Without limitation of the disclaimer of liability in the previous paragraph, any obligation we have to you will be suspended during the time and to the extent that we are prevented from, or delayed in, complying with that obligation by an event of Force Majeure. Your rights with respect to a confirmed booking affected by an event of Force Majeure will be subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant Supplier.
